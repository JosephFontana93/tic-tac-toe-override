# tic-tac-toe-override

Tic tac toe override is just like regular tic tac toe, but with a small twist. Each space starts of with having an override count of 1. Each time you place a piece down, the override count of that spot goes down 1 and each adjacent spot's count goes up 1. This creates a more strategical version of tic tac toe which typically does not end in a cat's game.

Placing a piece on the board requires you to enter a value 1 thru 9. It is very similar to the layout of a phone pad where 1 represents the top left and 9 represents the bottom right.
